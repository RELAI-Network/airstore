## Internationalization

[Flutter internationalization](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization) and [arb_translate package](https://pub.dev/packages/arb_translate) are used to auto translate internationalization files, using Gemini. More [details](https://leancode.co/blog/flutter-app-localization-with-ai).

1. Provide internationationalization messages for main file (fr).
2. Run _arb_translate_ in command line to complete arb translations files for other languages.
3. Run _flutter gen-l10n_ to generate dart translation files.

Follow [setup](https://pub.dev/packages/arb_translate#installation) instructions, to make sure everything is setted up on your local machine.
